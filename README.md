# Akhter AirPlay Receiver

## Project Overview

The **Akhter AirPlay Receiver** is a Java-based application designed to enable screen mirroring from an iPhone to an Android device using Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. The goal of this project is to provide a seamless and efficient way to receive AirPlay video streams on non-Apple devices, particularly for integration into interactive flat panels or Android-based devices.

### Key Features:
- **AirPlay Video Streaming**: Allows iPhone users to mirror their display to an Android device.
- **Real-time Mirroring**: Captures the video feed with minimal latency.
- **Video Streaming Protocol**: Built on top of Apple's AirPlay protocol, we are working to decode and display H.264 video streams.
- **Socket-based Communication**: Utilizes Netty for handling RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) and mirroring data transmission.
- **Scalable Design**: Can be easily integrated into other devices or platforms, such as smart TVs or projectors.

## Current Status

### What Works:
- The project can establish a connection between an iPhone and an Android device.
- Video mirroring works and allows iPhone screens to be streamed to Android devices.

### Known Issues:
- **Wi-Fi Reset Required**: The connection may fail after the first mirroring session, requiring a Wi-Fi reset on the iPhone to initiate a new connection. This is likely due to socket handling issues that need further investigation.
  - Observations:
    *   When a successful connection is made, there are no teardown requests from the iPhone. However, when the connection attempt fails (e.g., a failed screencast), the iPhone generates a teardown request, trying to close an old connection and start a new one. This suggests that the iPhone is trying to release a stuck network resource or connection that wasn’t properly closed by the Android receiver.
    During failed connection attempts, the iPhone attempts multiple teardown requests, likely trying to “free” resources from a previous connection that didn’t close properly. The teardown requests are futile if Android is unable to handle them, and they may indicate network resources like sockets are still open or in an inconsistent state.
    Upon reconnection attempts after failed screencasts, the logcat on Android shows a teardown request from the iPhone, even though a connection was never successfully made. This pattern indicates that Android may be holding on to resources from a failed session, preventing a new successful connection.
    Solution to be implemented:
    *	Review how Android manages network resources, such as sockets, to ensure that teardown requests are handled appropriately and all resources are released properly.
    *	Investigate the cycle of connection and disconnection between the iPhone and Android to identify why teardown requests are not processed as expected after a failed connection attempt.
    *	Ensure that Android’s AirPlay implementation fully closes all network connections and resources upon teardown, so that the iPhone can start fresh without leftover resources from the previous session.
- **Audio Handling**: Audio streams are not yet functional.
- **Socket Management**: There's ongoing work to improve socket handling, especially for closing and reopening sockets properly to allow reconnections without manual intervention.

## Future Goals
1. **Audio Support**: Enable full support for streaming audio along with video.
2. **Improved Socket Management**: Ensure that sockets are closed cleanly and reconnections are handled more smoothly.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce latency and improve video quality during mirroring.
4. **Scalability**: Extend compatibility to a wider range of devices and screen resolutions.
5. **Stability**: Focus on reducing the need for manual resets and ensuring stable, long-duration mirroring sessions.

## How It Works

1. The Android device runs the AirPlay receiver, which listens for AirPlay signals from an iPhone on the same network.
2. The iPhone connects via the AirPlay interface, and an RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) session is initiated.
3. The iPhone streams its video data, which is decoded and rendered on the Android device using Netty and the underlying mirroring components.
