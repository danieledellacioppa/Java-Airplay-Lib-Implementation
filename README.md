# Akhter AirPlay Receiver

## Project Overview

The **Akhter AirPlay Receiver** is a Java-based application designed to enable screen mirroring from an iPhone to an Android device using Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. The goal of this project is to provide a seamless and efficient way to receive AirPlay video streams on non-Apple devices, particularly for integration into interactive flat panels or Android-based devices.

### Key Features:
- **AirPlay Video Streaming**: Allows iPhone users to mirror their display to an Android device.
- **Real-time Mirroring**: Captures the video feed with minimal latency.
- **Video Streaming Protocol**: Built on top of Apple's AirPlay protocol, we are working to decode and display H.264 video streams.
- **Socket-based Communication**: Utilizes Netty for handling RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) and mirroring data transmission.
- **Scalable Design**: Can be easily integrated into other devices or platforms, such as smart TVs or projectors.

## Current Status

### What Works:
- The project can establish a connection between an iPhone and an Android device.
- Video mirroring works and allows iPhone screens to be streamed to Android devices.

### Known Issues:
- **Wi-Fi Reset Required**: The connection may fail after the first mirroring session, requiring a Wi-Fi reset on the iPhone to initiate a new connection. This is likely due to socket handling issues that need further investigation.
- **Audio Handling**: Audio streams are not yet functional.
- **Socket Management**: There's ongoing work to improve socket handling, especially for closing and reopening sockets properly to allow reconnections without manual intervention.

## Future Goals
1. **Audio Support**: Enable full support for streaming audio along with video.
2. **Improved Socket Management**: Ensure that sockets are closed cleanly and reconnections are handled more smoothly.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce latency and improve video quality during mirroring.
4. **Scalability**: Extend compatibility to a wider range of devices and screen resolutions.
5. **Stability**: Focus on reducing the need for manual resets and ensuring stable, long-duration mirroring sessions.

## How It Works

1. The Android device runs the AirPlay receiver, which listens for AirPlay signals from an iPhone on the same network.
2. The iPhone connects via the AirPlay interface, and an RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) session is initiated.
3. The iPhone streams its video data, which is decoded and rendered on the Android device using Netty and the underlying mirroring components.
